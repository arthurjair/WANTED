            <div class="project-infobox"><h2> Recently, I teamed up with Nathalie Silverentand, an artist from the Netherlands, for Semester 2. Our job? To give her brand a makeover and whip up a fresh website design. She wanted something simple yet colorful, so we kept that vibe in mind as we got creative.
                Our first crack at the website got dubbed "safe," "plain," even "boring" by our teachers. But their push for a more modern vibe really lit a fire under us. And you know what? It paid off big time when presentation day rolled around. Our risky move caught Nathalie's eye, and she picked our crew. We went all out, adding animations and splashes of color. And guess what? She loved it! That win made me realize it's okay to take a leap and shake things up.

            <h1>Initial Designs</h1>
            <p>Initially, all group members unanimously agreed that each member would create a design. The plan was to gather feedback from teachers, and then collaborate to merge our ideas into one cohesive design. So, I began working on my design. While browsing competitors' websites, I noticed they all embraced simplicity, allowing the artwork to shineâ€”just as my client desired. Thus, I crafted my version of a minimalistic website tailored to my client's preferences.</p>

        <p>After browsing competitors' websites, Mark Maggori's caught my eye as a prime example of a "minimalistic website." Drawing inspiration from his design, I incorporated similar details into my own. Given my client's preference for minimalism, I aimed to reflect this in my design. Following feedback, adjustments were suggested, such as refining the placement of quotes.</p>
