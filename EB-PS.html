            <h1>How I did it</h1>
            <p>For the media campaign, I took charge of crafting interview questions. After researching Breda, I prepared a set of inquiries, acquired a microphone, and journeyed to Breda with my team. <br> <br>In Breda's stadspark, I approached locals and asked about their typical activities with friends, favorite events, what makes Breda unique, hidden gems, and a brief description of the city. <br> <br> For non-locals, I inquired about their inspiration for choosing Breda as a destination, unique aspects they find appealing, and recommendations for future tourists.</p>

        <h1>How it helped</h1>
        <p>By conducting interviews, we discovered more about Breda, including secret spots and must-see places from both locals' and non-locals' perspectives. We learned what they like doing there and why they chose to live or study in Breda. All of this information helped us understand what we needed to convey in our campaign for Breda.
