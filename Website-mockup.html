Instead of presenting a static image, we opted to use Figma to create an interactive prototype. On presentation day, we showcased the prototype as if it were a fully functional website, complete with animations and working buttons. Nathalie, our client, was impressed by this approach as it allowed her to see the functionality and thoughtfulness behind our design.</div>
