            <p>Upon reading about my personality type, I discovered a strong alignment with my core values. I am curious, enthusiastic, and easy-going. However, the described weaknesses also resonate with me.

                <br> When it comes to career paths, I found myself in agreement with the analysis. I dislike repetitive jobs where every day is the same, having experienced that before. Instead, I thrive on working on diverse projects with different clients, as the variety and creativity involved are truly exciting.

I aim to run my own business specializing in website creation, becoming a proficient full-stack developer, and enhancing existing websites. If my plans change, I still seek a creative and innovative role within a company. I am dedicated to improving my coding skills, particularly in animation.</p>
