            <h1>What I did</h1>
            <p>After meeting Nathalie and learning about her, our group researched and created mood boards to capture our impressions of her work and decide how to display it. She uses bright colors and paints what she sees, blending realism with abstract elements, often incorporating vertical and horizontal lines. Despite this, she mentioned a preference for a minimalist look.</p>

            <h1>How I did it</h1>
            <p>After doing research, the group leader suggested we all create minimalist designs to understand each other's vision and potentially incorporate each other's ideas. I researched painters' websites and found that many have simple designs that let the art speak for itself. My design was inspired by the American painter Mark Maggiori's website.<br>
                I asked for feedback, and the teachers said it was very simple and safe. However, I decided to continue with it.

         <H1>Group minimalistic design</H1>
         <p>My group and I combined our ideas and sent them to the client for feedback. We kept most of my design but updated the navigation bar, added a white border around the paintings, and included yellow and blue lines to make it more colorful.</p>

            <h1>FINAL DESIGN</h1>
            <p>The final design concept was primarily my group member's idea, but I contributed by modernizing it with animations and helping create the About Me page.

                <br> We took a risk by changing the entire design to a more modern and bold look. On presentation day, we were excited but apprehensive about her reaction. Ultimately, it was a success; she chose our design because it resonated with her and stood out from the other groups. Sometimes, taking a risk pays off.</p>

        <h1>How it helped</h1>
        <p>This project has greatly influenced teachers' design expectations of me. Initially labeled as simple and safe, I was scared. Now, I aim to make each design more modern and daring to ensure my work stands out.</p>
