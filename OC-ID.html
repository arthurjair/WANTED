            <h1>How I did it</h1>
            <p>We began with brainstorming sessions to explore game concepts requiring teamwork. Inspired by "Overcooked," we introduced a twist with an octopus character, where each tentacle represented a player. In our game, players collaborated under limited resources and time to complete tasks efficiently. Failure to do so would result in undercooked burgers, adding urgency and challenge to the gameplay.

        <h1>How it helped</h1>
        <p>This mini assignment was my first experience collaborating in a group where everyone contributed ideas, emphasizing the importance of listening to each other. We carefully considered every aspect of the game, from tasks and utensils to creating paper items for gameplay. This experience taught me the significance of attention to detail and how small elements can enhance the overall project.</p>
