            <h1>What I did</h1>
            <p>For this project, I was excited to create a video for the media campaign and design posters. Inspired by the film "Trainspotting" and its powerful "Choose life" intro, a group member and I developed a similar concept:

                - "Choose Breda"
                - "Choose strolling in the park with your significant other," showcasing the park
                - "Choose..."
                - "Choose..."
                - "Choose..."
                - "Choose Breda… Explorebreda.nl"
                
                I saw great possibilities with this approach and was eager to bring it to life.</p>

            <h1>How I did it</h1>
            <p>I developed a concept that my group liked, so I began planning the filming locations to showcase Breda. I wrote a script but needed music. We couldn't use "Born Slippy" by Underworld due to copyright and recognizability.

                Finding a suitable replacement was challenging. We filmed in Breda, but the gloomy weather ruined the footage. The next day, a group member and I decided to pivot from the “choose life” idea. We brainstormed and decided to emulate Wes Anderson’s style, known for his unique color palettes and symmetry, for our project.

            <h1>FINAL DESIGN</h1>
            <p>The final design concept was primarily my group member's idea, but I contributed by modernizing it with animations and helping create the About Me page.

                <br> We took a risk by changing the entire design to a more modern and bold look. On presentation day, we were excited but apprehensive about her reaction. Ultimately, it was a success; she chose our design because it resonated with her and stood out from the other groups. Sometimes, taking a risk pays off.</p>
