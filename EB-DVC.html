            <p>Following up from the media campaign me and my group started researching on how people make easter eggs, and how it makes people come back to their website. Figured out that a lot of websites made games and would receive a reward for something and that would be how they would encourage people to come</p>

                Idea #1 Having a geese butt poking out behind an image and when a user would click it would turn around and say quack!

            <h1>Explore Breda scavenger hunt</h1>
            <p>Our Explore Breda development culminated in the Explore Breda scavenger hunt. Inspired by a group member, we conceived an annual event where participants hunt for golden eggs containing prizes, including a car. Website hints aid in the search, adding to the excitement. We chose this idea for its exclusivity and appeal. I proposed offering a car as a grand prize to attract more participants, with other prizes designed to promote visits to Breda for unique experiences or items.</p>

            <h1>Development part for the final product</h1>
            <p>For our project, we aimed to replicate the Explore Breda page for the winners of our scavenger hunt. Assigned to this task, I successfully recreated the page. Working collaboratively on Git, one group member added confetti effects, while another integrated the email message feature.</p>

        <h1>How it helped</h1>
        <p>At this stage of the year, it was really difficult for us as a group. We knew that contacting the client was going to be challenging, especially after the last project. Additionally, there were some difficulties between group members. However, this project helped me improve my coding skills and taught me new techniques for fixing certain issues in the code.
