                             <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                      <p2>After presentating my portfolio progress to Priyanka and my class I've received feedback on how to make my portfolio look better. I explained to my "Wanted/newspaper" concept to the class and a lot of people seemed to like it even Priyanka! The biggest feedback i got was to add a paper background to give my portfolio a more of a "newspaper look", I've tried and I didnt like it.</p>

                      <p>Robert seemed to like my concept, he said my hovers are nice he liked the animations and he liked the color scheme. He also gave me some design ideas like but A lot of the ideas were more of a "imagine how cool it would look if..." and I agreed hopefully I can keep adding more things to keep improving my portfolio.</p>

                      <p>For the learning outcomes I still feel like I don't have it fully right. Veerle told me to write as many instances for every learning outcome as possible. I explained to Erwin that my design was a little hard to put pictures so i asked what he thought and he said "A picture is worth a thousand words... add as many as you can" </p>

                      <p>After being graded I asked Veerle to explain to me my grading comment so I can be put in the right direction. I told her I had problems making my website responsive... still do but I've have gotten better at it.</p>

                      <p>Priyanka told me about the key things I needed for my Portfolio: a Slideshow, Flexbox or grid, and has to be responsive. Making my portfolio responsive was the hardest part and not yet fully responsive because of the code i've used. Im still learning and I want to better my code so that responsiveness won't be a issue for me in the future.</p>
